demo.py runs models/blip_pretrain_ego4d.py


# main file -Sayak please check
train_ego4d_2.py
check line 32 to 43(accuracy function),
line 60 and 62(within train function),
line 94,95,98-101,114 (within evaluation function),
line 120-126,167,186-188,196,201-205 (main function)

doubt:
what to do with these lines? delete them?
190-194, 207-250

# main file -Rinki please check
I have addressed all the concerns above
You need to create a config file
in the train code check wherever there is Rinki-> written and address those concerns
also please add a dataset call in demo.ipynb I need to check it before doing collate_fn
