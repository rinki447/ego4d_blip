demo.py runs models/blip_pretrain_ego4d.py


# main file -Sayak please check
Updated config file config/retrieval_flickr_ego4d.yaml by deleting unneccessary parameters, added some paths to the config inside train_ego4d_2.py  in line 307 to 314

# main file -Rinki please check
I have addressed all the concerns above
You need to create a config file
in the train code check wherever there is Rinki-> written and address those concerns
also please add a dataset call in demo.ipynb I need to check it before doing collate_fn
